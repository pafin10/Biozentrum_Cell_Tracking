for each session cell in dict, create a score based on 
    1. shape similarity with each global_mask_cell candidate and 
    2. overlap in the original position with each global mask cell candidate

check weighting visually, probably smth likk 70/30 or 80/20 towards shape similarity

That requires: research into sensible shape similarity computation methods (hausdorff, procrustes analysis, frechet distance)
then plot calculcated score in legend next to cells and mark choice

afterwards: cleanup of code. extract functions, avoid duplicate code and check that sequence of operations and transformations is sensible (in main)
